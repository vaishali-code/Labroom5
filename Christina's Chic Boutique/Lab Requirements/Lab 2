As in the first part of this lab, your group will be assigned one of the existing features to work on. This time around, your job is to properly encapsulate the model you've been assigned. This means that:

There should be no direct access to data members.
There should, howevr, be a way to modify data members.

You should also refactor any code that you believe could be better, leaving comments to explain your group's though process.
